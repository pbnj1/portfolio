## About Me

Software Engineer that utilizes skills of unique and creative problem solving, detailed documentation, excellent communication, and resourcefulness garnered from a profession in healthcare. I am mission-driven, growth-minded, and eager to help your team maintain and innovate new and exciting products and services.

I am passionate about helping others improve quality of life through technology. When I am not working I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking with our dog, and streaming too many hours of Netflix! I love animals, health and wellness, and doing my part to leave this world a better place.
