      <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
      <p>I am passionate about helping others improve quality of life through technology. 

I am a software engineer drawing on my transferrable skills of 15 years as a physical therapist to create solutions to complex problems, root cause analysis, and cross functional communication. I am searching for a junior/associate software engineering position. 
 
When I am not working I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking with our dog, and streaming too many hours of Netflix! I love animals, health and wellness, and doing my part to leave this world a better place.</p>
